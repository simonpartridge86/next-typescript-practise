This app was created by following [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTuHnVvxTDs&ab_channel=TomDoesTech)
and using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

My aim was to practise using Typescript with Next.js for the first time, learning about handling SSG and SSR functionality with Typescript.

I now plan to use this new understanding to create a more advanced [interactive Periodic Table app](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/periodic-table).
